		<h4>How to play?</h4>
		<p>
			One needs to rotate cells so their alignment can allow the current to
			pass through them. There is one green radial source of the current, that
			can also be rotated. A cell has a current flowing through it when it
			turns green.
		</p>
		<h4>Controls</h4>
		<p>
			Left click = Rotate counter-clockwise<br />Right click = Rotate
			clockwise<br />Middle click = lock a cell against rotation
		</p>
